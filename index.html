                <p>
                    I chose the content package "What comes after the environment? at Canadian Centre for Architecture" for my poster. I did not do a ton of additional research for this because I felt like I had a solid idea of what I could achieve and what kind of design I might like to create. The examples from class that showed the kinds of interactions we could do gave me some ideas about what I could achieve for mine. For typefaces, I decided to use my CSS Typeface for a header as it was best for large display text since it was so large and bold. I did some research into different typefaces I could add and I chose <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-kansas">New Kansas</a> from Adobe Fonts for sub-headers because the serifs created a nice contrast and it has a rounded look that compliments my round header sans-serif typeface. For body text and other sub-headers I chose <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/basic-sans">Basic Sans</a> which is also from Adobe Fonts because it is readable and also has a curving style similar to my other two typefaces. There was overall a friendly appearance created by these typefaces but they are also fairly bold, which I think works well to communicate the message of the content package.

                <h2>Draft 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I had my typefaces, content package, and ideas about the direction I wanted to go, I drafted this poster. I went with a green theme to match the environmental idea of the content package and I set up columns and rows for my content. I set my CSS typeface as the header by putting it all in one div and I used media query to adjust it based on screen size, but had some struggles with that so it often cut of the text or was too small for the screen. I set my other type to size based on viewport width/height though so that part worked, just the header had some issues. This draft was also fairly static as the only animations/interactive elements were a few scale and translation movements upon hovering. I wanted to animate the header but the CSS typeface being set to position: absolute and all the different small elements in each letter made it tough to figure out, especially with having to scale it based on screen size.

                <h2>Draft 2</h2>
                <p>
                    After the one-on-one critique for my poster I made a bunch of changes to make it more engaging and interactive. I fixed the media query sizing issues and animation issues with my header by turning it into a marquee, this way it didn't have to be scaled and it had some movement to it. I added a lot of time based opacity animations to better convey the urgency of the environmental issue of the poster. I also added some more sections like info about the speakers, a fixed position sticker to buy tickets, and more links like to find the location on maps and more info about the event and speakers. I also adjusted the hierarchy to make things like date and location more prominent.

                <h2>Final Draft</h2>
                <p>
                    My final draft is very similar in layout to the previous version but I made some fine-tuning changes like adjusting the position of the sticker and fixing the margins. I changed the colour palette to keep the neon colour for urgency but changed the green to red to be less calm and a bit more indicative of danger. I also added a duplicate marquee on the bottom to tie it together more and kind of represent how we are kind of in a loop with climate change and not enough being done (but mostly to provide a sense of balance and finality to the composition). Finally, I adjusted the media query so that the layout of content changed on a phone for easier readibility and to eliminate any overlapping of elements. I am overall pretty happy with what I created as I learned a lot of new ways to create interactivity and I think I represented the content package well. Next steps if I were to continue working on it would probably be adding more complex animations and maybe playing around with the layout a bit more.
